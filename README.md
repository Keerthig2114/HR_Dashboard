# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This repository hosts an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Tableau. The dashboard provides key insights into workforce dynamics, including attrition trends, employee demographics, and job satisfaction ratings, enabling data-driven decision-making for human resources management.

## Features

* **Employee Count & Attrition:** Snapshot of total employees and the attrition rate.
* **Department-wise Attrition:** Visual breakdown of attrition across different departments.
* **Employee Distribution by Age Group:** Insights into the age demographics of the workforce.
* **Job Satisfaction Rating:** Analysis of employee satisfaction levels.
* **Education Field-wise Attrition:** Understanding attrition based on educational backgrounds.
* **Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups:** Detailed view of attrition patterns across gender and age.

### Visualizations Used

The HR Analytics Dashboard effectively utilizes a variety of visualization types to present insights clearly:

* **KPI Cards/Scorecards:** Prominently displayed at the top, showing key aggregate metrics like "Employee Count" , "Attrition Count" , "Attrition Rate" , "Active Employee" , and "Avg. Age" .
* **Pie Chart:** Used for "Department wise Attrition" to show the proportional breakdown of attrition across departments.
* **Bar Chart (Vertical/Column Chart):**
    * "No of Employees by Age group": Shows the distribution of employees across different age buckets.
    * "Job Satisfaction Rating": Displays the count of employees for each job role across different satisfaction levels (1, 2, 3, 4). This appears to be a grouped or stacked bar chart implicitly, showing counts per rating for each department.
* **Bar Chart (Horizontal/Row Chart):** Used for "Education Field wise Attrition" to show attrition count for different education fields (e.g., Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing, etc.).
* **Donut Charts (Multiple):** Used in the "Attrition Rate by Gender for different age group" section to show the male and female attrition percentages within specific age brackets.
